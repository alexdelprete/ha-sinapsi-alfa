# Release Notes - v1.1.2

**Release Date:** 2025-12-18

## Overview

**Patch release** - Fixes UI translation issues in the configuration and options flows.

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed Missing Translation for Skip MAC Detection

The "Skip MAC Detection" checkbox was displaying the variable name `skip_mac_detection` instead of a proper label.
This has been fixed by adding translations to both English and Portuguese language files.

**Before:** `skip_mac_detection` (variable name)
**After:** "Skip MAC Detection" (English) / "Ignorar Deteção MAC" (Portuguese)

### Improved Connection Timeout Field Spacing

The Connection Timeout field had a long label that was too close to the slider control. The label has been shortened and a separate description field added below for better UX.

**Before:** "Connection Timeout in seconds (min: 5s max: 60s)" (all in label)
**After:**

- Label: "Connection Timeout"
- Description: "Timeout in seconds for Modbus connection (min: 5s, max: 60s). Increase for VPN/WAN connections."

## Documentation

### Added `data_description` Sections

Added `data_description` sections to translation files, which provide helpful descriptions below form fields in Home Assistant's configuration UI:

| Field                | Description                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `timeout`            | "Timeout in seconds for Modbus connection (min: 5s, max: 60s). Increase for VPN/WAN connections." |
| `skip_mac_detection` | "Enable for VPN connections. Uses host-based device ID instead of MAC address (faster startup)."  |

### Updated Portuguese Translations

All new fields have been translated to Portuguese for users with that language setting.
