[![GitHub Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/alexdelprete/ha-sinapsi-alfa/v1.2.5/total?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/alexdelprete/ha-sinapsi-alfa/releases/tag/v1.2.5)

**Release Date:** 2026-01-08

**Patch release** - Lower minimum polling interval for faster sensor updates.

## What's Changed

### Improvements

- **Lower minimum polling interval** - Reduced minimum scan interval from 30 seconds to 10 seconds, allowing
  more responsive sensor updates for users who need near real-time power monitoring

## Issue Addressed

This release addresses [#74](https://github.com/alexdelprete/ha-sinapsi-alfa/issues/74) - Feature request for
polling interval less than 30 seconds.

Thanks to [@sigitm](https://github.com/sigitm) for the feature request! The user needed faster updates for the
"Potenza Prelevata" sensor to enable proactive notifications when power consumption spikes.

## Technical Details

- Changed `MIN_SCAN_INTERVAL` constant from 30 to 10 in `const.py`
- This affects both the Options flow and Reconfigure flow validation (via `vol.Clamp()`)
- The coordinator also enforces this minimum at runtime

## Why Not Lower Than 10 Seconds?

Home Assistant's built-in Modbus integration enforces a minimum of 5 seconds and logs a warning if you go below
that threshold ([source code](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/6e32a2aa18babf95999db24aa77b0e67d5be09cc/homeassistant/components/modbus/validators.py#L382)).

The reason isn't protocol-related—the Alfa device handles frequent polling fine. The issue is **Home Assistant
architecture**: as explained by [bdraco](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/actual-limitations-on-scan-interval/470436/3)
(HA core developer), every state change event is propagated to:

- All frontend clients (web UI)
- Mobile apps
- The database (stored on disk)
- All integrations listening for state changes

Polling too frequently can cause:

- **Sluggish frontend** - UI becomes unresponsive
- **Battery drain on mobile** - Constant updates consume power
- **Bloated database** - Excessive history entries
- **Downstream performance issues** - Other integrations struggle to keep up

This integration sets 10 seconds as the minimum—a conservative choice that balances responsiveness with system
health. For users who absolutely need faster updates for specific sensors, the standard HA Modbus integration
can be configured separately for individual registers.
