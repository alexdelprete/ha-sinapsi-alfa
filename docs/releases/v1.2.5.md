[![GitHub Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/alexdelprete/ha-sinapsi-alfa/v1.2.5/total?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/alexdelprete/ha-sinapsi-alfa/releases/tag/v1.2.5)

**Release Date:** 2026-01-08

**Patch release** - Lower minimum polling interval for faster sensor updates.

## What's Changed

### Improvements

- **Lower minimum polling interval** - Reduced minimum scan interval from 30 seconds to 10 seconds, allowing
  more responsive sensor updates for users who need near real-time power monitoring

## Issue Addressed

This release addresses [#74](https://github.com/alexdelprete/ha-sinapsi-alfa/issues/74) - Feature request for
polling interval less than 30 seconds.

Thanks to [@sigitm](https://github.com/sigitm) for the feature request! The user needed faster updates for the
"Potenza Prelevata" sensor to enable proactive notifications when power consumption spikes.

## Technical Details

- Changed `MIN_SCAN_INTERVAL` constant from 30 to 10 in `const.py`
- This affects both the Options flow and Reconfigure flow validation (via `vol.Clamp()`)
- The coordinator also enforces this minimum at runtime

## Notes

- While 10 seconds is now the minimum, users should consider their network and device capabilities
- The Alfa device handles frequent polling well, but very aggressive polling (e.g., 1-2 seconds as originally
  requested) is not recommended as it may cause protocol errors
- For most use cases, 10-30 seconds provides a good balance between responsiveness and reliability
