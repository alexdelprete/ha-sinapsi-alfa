# Release v1.2.10

[![GitHub Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/alexdelprete/ha-sinapsi-alfa/v1.2.10/total?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/alexdelprete/ha-sinapsi-alfa/releases/tag/v1.2.10)

## What's Changed

### New Features

- **ModbusLink 1.4.2 flush() pattern** - Implements lightweight error recovery using the new `flush()` method
  introduced in ModbusLink 1.4.2. When timeout or protocol errors occur, the integration now clears stale
  data from the TCP receive buffer before attempting recovery, which is faster and more reliable than
  immediately resetting the connection.

### Dependencies

- **ModbusLink 1.4.2** - Updated to use the new `flush()` method for robust error recovery
- **Compatible release specifier** - Changed from `>=1.4.2` to `~=1.4.2` (PEP 440) to protect against
  breaking changes from minor version bumps. This allows patch releases (1.4.3, 1.4.4) but blocks
  potentially breaking minor releases (1.5.0+).

### Technical Details

The new error recovery strategy:

1. On timeout/protocol error → call `flush()` to clear stale responses
2. Increment protocol error counter
3. Only reset connection if error threshold is reached

This aligns with the Home Assistant integration pattern recommended by the ModbusLink developer.
