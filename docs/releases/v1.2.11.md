## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed multi-device support** - The integration now correctly allows adding multiple Alfa devices
  (Fixes [#195](https://github.com/alexdelprete/ha-sinapsi-alfa/issues/195))

  The codebase was already architecturally designed to support multiple devices (each config entry has
  its own coordinator, API client, and runtime data), but `manifest.json` had `single_config_entry: true`
  which blocked adding more than one device. This has been corrected to `single_config_entry: false`.

  **For VPN users:** When adding a remote Alfa device over VPN, enable the **"Skip MAC Detection"** option
  during setup to avoid timeout issues with MAC address retrieval over slow connections.

- **Fixed Hassfest validation** - Removed URLs from translation description strings (Hassfest requires
  using description placeholders instead of direct URLs)

### Acknowledgments

Thanks to [@jnob1](https://github.com/jnob1) for reporting the multi-device issue! Their detailed report
on the HA Community forum helped identify that the documentation said multi-device was supported, but
the manifest setting was blocking it.
