# Release Notes - v1.1.4

**Release Date:** 2025-12-18

## Overview

**Patch release** - Changes Connection Timeout from slider to number input field for better UX.

## Bug Fixes

### Changed Connection Timeout to Number Input

The Connection Timeout field was displaying as a slider which didn't work well with the `data_description` text.
Changed to a simple number input field (like Polling Period uses in practice).

**Before:** Slider with range 5-60
**After:** Number input field with range info in label

### Added Timeout Bounds Enforcement

Added validation in the coordinator to enforce timeout bounds (5-60 seconds), similar to how scan_interval is handled. Values outside the range are automatically clamped.
