# Release Notes - v1.1.6

**Release Date:** 2025-12-19

## Overview

**Patch release** - Fixes critical bug where ModbusLink requirement `>=1.3.2` couldn't be satisfied because the language fix was released in v1.3.1, not v1.3.2.

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed ModbusLink Version Requirement

The v1.1.5 release specified `modbuslink>=1.3.2` in manifest.json, but the language configuration feature was actually released in v1.3.1 (not v1.3.2 as the developer initially stated). This caused the integration to fail loading because the requirement couldn't be satisfied.

**Before:** `modbuslink>=1.3.2` (doesn't exist)
**After:** `modbuslink>=1.3.1` (correct version with language support)
