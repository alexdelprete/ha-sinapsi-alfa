**Release Date:** 2025-12-11

## Overview

**Patch release** - Fixes inverted import/export sensor icons.

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed Inverted Import/Export Icons (Fixes #178)

The MDI transmission tower icons were incorrectly assigned based on the home's perspective instead of the grid's (tower's) perspective:

| Sensor Type | Italian Name | Old Icon                    | New Icon                    |
| ----------- | ------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Home Import | Prelevata    | `transmission-tower-import` | `transmission-tower-export` |
| Home Export | Immessa      | `transmission-tower-export` | `transmission-tower-import` |

**Explanation:**

- `mdi:transmission-tower-export` = arrow OUT from tower = grid sending energy = home importing (Prelevata)
- `mdi:transmission-tower-import` = arrow INTO tower = grid receiving energy = home exporting (Immessa)

**Affected Sensors (14 total):**

- All "Prelevata" sensors (power, energy, daily F1-F6)
- All "Immessa" sensors (power, energy, daily F1-F6)
