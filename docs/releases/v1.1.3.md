# Release Notes - v1.1.3

**Release Date:** 2025-12-18

## Overview

**Patch release** - Fixes Connection Timeout slider description display issue in the configuration UI.

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed Connection Timeout Description Display

The `data_description` field for slider controls doesn't render properly in Home Assistant's config flow UI - the description text appears cramped and messy below the slider.

**Solution:** Removed `data_description` for the timeout field and moved the range information back into the field label (consistent with how `scan_interval` is displayed).

**Before:** Label "Connection Timeout" with messy description below slider
**After:** Label "Connection Timeout (min: 5s max: 60s)" with no description

The `data_description` for checkbox fields (like Skip MAC Detection) works correctly and has been retained.
